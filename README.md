# Mappings Editor

The Mappings Editor is a tool developed by the [Center for Threat Informed
Defense](https://mitre-engenuity.org/cybersecurity/center-for-threat-informed-defense/).
This tool is used by our internal team to produce our [Mappings
Explorer](https://center-for-threat-informed-defense.github.io/mappings-explorer/) data,
which maps popular security capabilities to the MITRE ATT&CK® knowledge base. We have
made this tool available as an open source project in *public beta*.

## Getting Started

**For most users, you should start with Mappings Explorer,** which is the website where
we publish our open source mappings data in a searchable/navigable format with many
options for downloading the data in spreadsheet or machine-readable formats.

If you want to produce your own, customized, mappings data, then you should use this
*public beta* of the Mappings Editor tool. To get started, review the Editor
Documentation to learn how to create the initial, empty mappings file. Then click  the
link below to launch the Mappings Editor web app.

## How Do I Contribute?

We welcome your feedback and contributions to help advance Mappings Editor. Please see
the guidance for contributors if are you interested in [contributing.](/CONTRIBUTING.md)

**The Mappings Editor is released as a *public beta*.** You may try using it to create
your own mappings data, but please note that we can only offer limited support for the
tool at this time, and the tool is subject to change as we refine the capabilities. The
mappings data can be used internally inside your organization, or if you produce
mappings for public benefit, please [get in touch with
us]((mailto:ctid@mitre-engenuity.org?subject=Mappings%20Explorer%20framework%20submission))
to discuss merging your work into our project.

Please submit
