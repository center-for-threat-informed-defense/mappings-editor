# Mappings Editor

The Mappings Editor is a custom-built tool developed under the Mappings Explorer project. 
This lightweight, easy to use tool is being used internally by the [Center for Threat Informed Defense](https://mitre-engenuity.org/cybersecurity/center-for-threat-informed-defense/) 
to create new and update existing capability mappings to [MITRE ATT&CKÂ®](https://attack.mitre.org/) objects. 
It is available for your own use as a public beta, but most Mappings Explorer users should 
not need to use this tool. Instead, you should generally use the mappings data available on 
the Mappings Explorer website.
