# Mappings Editor

Mappings Editor is a custom-built tool developed under the Mappings Explorer project. This 
tool enables the mapping of customized security controls or capabilities to [MITRE ATT&CKÂ®](https://attack.mitre.org/), 
either to be used solely internally within an organization or shared with the Center or other 
organizations. This lightweight, easy to use tool is being used internally by the Center to 
create new and update existing capability mappings to ATT&CK objects.
